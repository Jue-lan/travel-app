## Reflection

### How did your group approach the requirements? (mention anything unique or creative your group chose to do)

- Our team took about 30 discussing how we understood the requirements and wireframe to be.
- We used the screen writing tools to communicate how we would break the page layout into backend components.

### What was easier than you thought? What was more challenging?

- What was more challenging was understanding within which component we needed to house our data. Compared to the labs, we envisioned our App to be deeper in it’s construction of modules and components than wide.

### What is a lesson you will carry forward to working on your next project?

- Thorough discussion on what you understand the project to be and through discussion about how you intend to frame your backend is one of the most important things. It helps prevent a ton of refactoring and gives an added boost to teamwork as there is a good foundation for peers to easily transition in and out of various work tasks.

- A solid understanding of passing data from one parent component to a child component. Also on how to better plan out our routes for the project.

- Something we learned is that for dividing up the work, we found that not having both of us working on seperate functionalities and not on vulnerable things worked the best for us. For example if Juelan was working on the routes then I would be working on either a component that is already well defined or one not yet implemented.
